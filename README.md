# MP4 to MP3 Converter - Quick Guide

## How to Use?
1. Place your **MP4 file** in the same folder as `main.py`.
2. Open **Terminal** and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Your **MP3 file** (`output.mp3`) will be saved in the same folder.

## Troubleshooting
- Missing dependencies? Install them:
  ```bash
  pip install moviepy imageio[ffmpeg]
  ```
- Rename the MP4 file if needed and try again.
